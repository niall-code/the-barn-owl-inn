## Design Stage

### Wireframes

I sketched initial wireframes of the home page and of the tables selection screen that will be a key part of the reservation process.

### User Stories

I planned my user stories and their acceptance criteria on paper, with some conversational assistance from a relative - who has experience of converting ideas in to formulaic written forms. I then transferred them to a GitHub Projects kanban board.

## Development Stage



## Deployment Stage



## gitignore and slugignore



I added `readme_images/` to a `.slugignore` file, because the screenshots and photos in this readme will not be required by the deployed site. [Heroku's documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/slug-compiler#ignoring-files-with-slugignore) suggests that this should cause that directory's "files to be removed after you push code to Heroku and before the buildpack runs", so that large, unnecessary files are not included.

## Credit

- As mentioned above, a relative helped with phrasing and structuring my user stories/acceptance criteria.
